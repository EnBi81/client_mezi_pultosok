# Mezi Pultos GÃ¡rda

A React Native application that allows users to view the schedules of bartenders (pultosok). 
The app features light/dark modes, sun-synced mode, hungarian and english locales, and push notifications for updates.

Note: This project is **developed only for Android devices**, as I don't have a MacBook to
develop this app on.
